&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the great new features in &lt;a href=&quot;http://grails.org&quot;&gt;Grails&lt;/a&gt; 2.3 is the ability to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eclipse.org/aether/&quot;&gt;Aether&lt;/a&gt; to resolve dependencies in place of Ivy.  This is great news if
you already use &lt;a href=&quot;http://maven.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Maven&lt;/a&gt; to build other projects, as it now means you can have predictable builds between your &lt;a href=&quot;http://grails.org&quot;&gt;Grails&lt;/a&gt; and non-http://grails.org[Grails] applications.  However, like
any new feature, there are a few rough edges.  I ran into one the other day when trying to determine why one of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://grails.org&quot;&gt;Grails&lt;/a&gt; applications was not picking up dependencies from the local &lt;a href=&quot;http://maven.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Maven&lt;/a&gt;
cache  (&lt;code&gt;~/.m2/repository&lt;/code&gt;).  After some digging around, I ran across &lt;a href=&quot;http://jira.grails.org/browse/GRAILS-10921&quot;&gt;this bug&lt;/a&gt;.  According to it, the mavenLocal directive in the
repositories section of &lt;code&gt;BuildConfig.groovy&lt;/code&gt; is not honored when using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eclipse.org/aether/&quot;&gt;Aether&lt;/a&gt; resolver.  So that stinks.  I quickly realized that we could make the &lt;a href=&quot;http://grails.org&quot;&gt;Grails&lt;/a&gt; dependency resolver
DSL pick up the local &lt;a href=&quot;http://maven.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Maven&lt;/a&gt; repository by simply adding a new file-based repository:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;listingblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint groovy language-groovy&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;    repositories {
        inherits true // Whether to inherit repository definitions from plugins

        mavenRepo &quot;file://${System.getProperty(&apos;user.home&apos;)}/.m2/repository&quot;

        ...
    }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This little hack will allow you to continue checking the local &lt;a href=&quot;http://maven.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Maven&lt;/a&gt; repository when using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://grails.org&quot;&gt;Grails&lt;/a&gt; command line tools and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://grails.org/doc/2.3.x/guide/introduction.html#whatsNew23&quot;&gt;Maven dependency resolution support&lt;/a&gt;
new to &lt;a href=&quot;http://grails.org&quot;&gt;Grails&lt;/a&gt; 2.3.  The nice thing about this is that when/if the issue is fixed so that the local &lt;a href=&quot;http://maven.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Maven&lt;/a&gt; repository is honored, this fix should not cause any issues.  Not long after I made this fix,
I went to build the application on &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenkins-ci.org/&quot;&gt;Jenkins&lt;/a&gt; and notice some more funny business with dependencies.  After some digging, I determined the issue was due to the fact that now that the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://grails.org&quot;&gt;Grails&lt;/a&gt; applications were using &lt;a href=&quot;http://maven.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Maven&lt;/a&gt; for dependency resolution and not Ivy, they were sharing one local dependency cache.  When the Jenkins job is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://maven.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Maven&lt;/a&gt; project, I typically choose
the option to create a repository per workspace, to avoid collisions between jobs.  With a &lt;a href=&quot;http://grails.org&quot;&gt;Grails&lt;/a&gt; job, you do not have this option.  The option that you do have is setting the
&lt;code&gt;grails.dependency.cache.dir&lt;/code&gt; build property to tell &lt;a href=&quot;http://grails.org&quot;&gt;Grails&lt;/a&gt; where to cache and look for local dependencies.  I decided to conditionally set this based on whether or not the application
was being built on Jenkins or not (the reason for this is that I already have it set in my local &lt;code&gt;~/.grails/settings.groovy&lt;/code&gt; to have a separate cache per application).  Once again,
I modified the BuildConfig.groovy file to contain the following logic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;listingblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint groovy language-groovy&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;    final String localMavenRepo = System.getenv(&apos;JENKINS_HOME&apos;) ? &quot;${System.getenv(&apos;WORKSPACE&apos;)}/.m2/repository&quot; :
                                        &quot;${System.getProperty(&apos;user.home&apos;)}/.m2/repository&quot;

    ...

    /**
      * If the build is being executed on Jenkins, set up the ivy cache.  This
      * is important as Grails checks to see if this has been set before allowing
      * an override of the local Maven repository.
      */
    if(System.getenv(&apos;JENKINS_HOME&apos;)) {
        grails.dependency.cache.dir = localMavenRepo
    }

    grails.project.dependency.resolver = &quot;maven&quot; // or ivy
    grails.project.dependency.resolution = {
        pom true

        // inherit Grails&apos; default dependencies
        inherits(&quot;global&quot;) {
        }

        log &quot;error&quot; // log level of Ivy resolver, either &apos;error&apos;, &apos;warn&apos;, &apos;info&apos;, &apos;debug&apos; or &apos;verbose&apos;
        checksums false // Whether to verify checksums on resolve
        legacyResolve false // whether to do a secondary resolve on plugin installation, not advised and here for backwards compatibility
        localRepository = localMavenRepo

        repositories {
            inherits true // Whether to inherit repository definitions from plugins

            mavenRepo &quot;file://${localMavenRepo}&quot;

            ...
        }
    }

    ...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s worth noting that in the example above, I not only set the &lt;code&gt;grails.dependency.cache.dir&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://grails.org&quot;&gt;Grails&lt;/a&gt; build property, but
I also set the &lt;code&gt;localRepository&lt;/code&gt; property of the dependency resolution DSL to ensure that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://maven.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Maven&lt;/a&gt; dependency resolution is using it both as a place to check
for dependencies AND a place to store the cached dependencies (see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/grails/grails-core/blob/2.3.x/grails-aether/src/main/groovy/org/codehaus/groovy/grails/resolve/maven/aether/AetherDependencyManager.groovy&quot;&gt;AetherDependencyManager.groovy&lt;/a&gt; source
file in the &lt;code&gt;grails-aether&lt;/code&gt; module for more details).  Now when the application builds on Jenkins, not only does it have a local &lt;a href=&quot;http://maven.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Maven&lt;/a&gt; repository as part of
the list of repositories, but that repository is stored in the workspace for the Jenkins build job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to get myself to start blogging more regularly, I have decided to re-do my blog (which has largely been dormant).  A few days ago,
I read an interesting blog post by &lt;a href=&quot;http://melix.github.io/blog//2014/02/hosting-jbake-github.html&quot;&gt;CÃ©dric Champeau&lt;/a&gt; about using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jbake.org&quot;&gt;JBake&lt;/a&gt; to generate
blog posts from &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/&quot;&gt;AsciiDoc&lt;/a&gt; or HTML and publish them to &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.  The blog post is pretty straight forward and with some minor tweaks
I was able to give my blog a makeover.  Additionally, its much easier now to author and publish posts.  Over the next few weeks, I am going to continue
to make tweaks to give the blog my own style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            <title>Where&apos;s My Exceptions, Spring Data MongoDB?</title>
            <link>http://jdpgrailsdev.github.io/blog//2011/11/19/spring_data_mongodb_exceptions.html</link>

            <description>
                    &lt;p&gt;To be fair, the Spring Data MongoDB project is currently only at Milestone releases (as of writing, they are up to M5). Unlike most open source projects, they do have fairly good reference documentation. Recently, we decided to add some unique contraints to a document by adding a compound index. The Spring Data MongoDB project provides a couple mechanisms to be able to do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the MongoTemplate class&apos;s ensureIndex method to programmatically create an index at runtime.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the CompoundIndexes and CompoundIndex annotations to declare the indexes on the document model class.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Manually create the index(es) against the database using the MongoDB command line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a variety of reasons, I decided to go with option #2. Using the annotations is pretty straight forward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;package test;

import org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.index.CompoundIndex;
import org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.index.CompoundIndexes;
import org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.mapping.Document;

@Document(collection=&amp;quot;people&amp;quot;)
@CompoundIndexes(value={
    @CompoundIndex(name=&amp;quot;people_first_name_address_idx&amp;quot;, def=&amp;quot;{&amp;#39;firstName&amp;#39;:1, &amp;#39;address&amp;#39;:1}&amp;quot;, unique=true),
    @CompoundIndex(name=&amp;quot;people_last_name_address_idx&amp;quot;, def=&amp;quot;{&amp;#39;lastName&amp;#39;:1, &amp;#39;address&amp;#39;:1}&amp;quot;, unique=true)
})
public class Person {

    private String address;
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;

    ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The example above declares two MongoDB compound indexes. In the first one, it is creating an index on the firstName and address properties of the document. The &quot;:1&quot; tells the index to sort that column in ascending order for the index (see the org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.query.Order class&apos;s Javadoc for more details on sort orders). The &quot;unique=true&quot; property tells MongoDB to reject any inserts/saves that violate this contraint (think a unique contraint in the SQL world). There are other properties on the CompoundIndex annotation, so refer to the Spring Data MongoDB Javadocs for more information. When the application starts up, the Spring Data MongoDB library listens for the application start event via Spring and will create the indexes automatically (if they don&apos;t already exist). This is a benefit over options 1 and 3 above that require manual intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So Why Didn&apos;t It Work?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the paragraph above, it is pretty easy to set up indexes using Spring Data MongoDB. You annotate your classes, start your application and run some tests to make sure the unique constraint is being honored, right? That&apos;s what I thought too. I started out by annotating my document objects and re-building my application. Before installing and starting my application in Tomcat, I decided to completely drop my database from MongoDB to ensure that everything was being created properly. Once I was sure everything was clean, I installed my application and started Tomcat, causing Spring Data MongoDB to create the database, the collections and the indexes when the web application started. I verified this by running the following command in MongoDB to see the indexes existed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;MongoDB shell version: 1.8.2
connecting to: test
&amp;gt; db.people.getIndexes()
[
        {
                &amp;quot;name&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;_id_&amp;quot;,
                &amp;quot;ns&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;test.people&amp;quot;,
                &amp;quot;key&amp;quot; : {
                     &amp;quot;_id&amp;quot; : 1
                },
                &amp;quot;v&amp;quot; : 0
        },
        {
                &amp;quot;name&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;people_first_name_address_idx&amp;quot;,
                &amp;quot;ns&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;test.people&amp;quot;,
          &amp;quot;dropDups&amp;quot; : false,
          &amp;quot;sparse&amp;quot; : false,
          &amp;quot;unique&amp;quot; : true,
          &amp;quot;key&amp;quot; : {
                        &amp;quot;firstName&amp;quot; : 1,
                        &amp;quot;address&amp;quot; : 1
                },
                &amp;quot;v&amp;quot; : 0
        },
        {
                &amp;quot;name&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;people_last_name_address_idx&amp;quot;,
              &amp;quot;ns&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;test.people&amp;quot;,
                &amp;quot;dropDups&amp;quot; : false,
          &amp;quot;sparse&amp;quot; : false,
          &amp;quot;unique&amp;quot; : true,
                &amp;quot;key&amp;quot; : {
                    &amp;quot;lastName&amp;quot; : 1,
                    &amp;quot;address&amp;quot; : 1
                },
                &amp;quot;v&amp;quot; : 0
        }
]
&amp;gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This allowed me to verify that Spring Data MongoDB actually did create the indexes at startup. So far, so good. My next step was to insert some data to the collection via my application. This worked and I was able to verify the document in MongoDB by using the .find({}) operation on the collection from the command line. The next step was to attempt to insert the exact same document, which should fail due to the unique constraints. To my surprise, it did not fail and I did not receive any exceptions from the MongoTemplate class (which executed the insert). Just to make sure I wasn&apos;t crazy, I took the JSON and inserted it directly to the collection using the .save({...}) operation on the collection via the Mongo command line. It did exactly what I expected it to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;E11000 duplicate key error index: test-people.$people_first_name_address_idx  dup key: { : &amp;quot;John&amp;quot;, : &amp;quot;123 Fake Street&amp;quot; }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This meant that index was working. So what was Spring Data MongoDB&apos;s problem? What was happening to the error? After some Google-foo, I stumbled across this JIRA issue: &lt;a href=&quot;https://jira.springsource.org/browse/DATAMONGO-134&quot;&gt;https://jira.springsource.org/browse/DATAMONGO-134&lt;/a&gt;. Hidden in there was the answer to my problem. By default, the MongoTemplate class uses the default WriteConcern from the MongoDB Java Driver library. The default WriteConcern as it turns out does NOT raise exceptions for server errors, only network errors. This means that you will only receive an exception if you lose connection to the database or try to connect to an invalid address/port and will not receive an exception for any errors generated by MongoDB. Lame, but easy to fix. The WriteConcern class comes with some static constants that define the following write concern options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/** No exceptions are raised, even for network issues */
public final static WriteConcern NONE = new WriteConcern(-1);

/** Exceptions are raised for network issues, but not server errors */
public final static WriteConcern NORMAL = new WriteConcern(0);

/** Exceptions are raised for network issues, and server errors; waits on a server for the write operation */
public final static WriteConcern SAFE = new WriteConcern(1);

/** Exceptions are raised for network issues, and server errors and the write operation waits for the server to flush the data to disk*/
public final static WriteConcern FSYNC_SAFE = new WriteConcern(true);

/** Exceptions are raised for network issues, and server errors; waits for at least 2 servers for the write operation*/
public final static WriteConcern REPLICAS_SAFE = new WriteConcern(2);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, depending on your needs, you can change the write concern options used by the MongoTemplate class. Since I was using Spring to instantiate the MongoTemplate class, this required a couple of changes to my applicationContext.xml file:&lt;/p&gt;

However, the MongoTemplate class does have a setWriteConcern method for this very reason and it would have saved me some time if the reference documentation had mentioned this and/or had some examples on how to change the setting. I guess that will be in the &quot;release&quot; :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;At some point, if you fly enough, you go through one of those &quot;trips from hell&quot; thanks to the airline industry. Weather gets in the way of travel or you get delayed just enough that you miss that connection and spend the night sleeping in the airport in Little Rock, Arkansas. Then there are those trips that just highlight the complete breakdown in rational thought and competence. This is the story of my attempt to get from Burlington, VT to Washington-Dulles International Airport. It will make you laugh. It will make you cry. It will make you understand why you should never fly United Airlines. It will also highlight why doing just a little extra to help your customers goes a long way (instead of choosing the tactics United uses to treat its customers like boxes of diapers being shipped from a distribution center to a Walmart -- i.e., it gets there when it gets there).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Storm on the Horizon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, it would have made more&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;sense to just rent a car and drive the 10 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;I finished up at work and headed to the airport a little after 5 PM on Friday. My flight was scheduled to leave Burlington, VT at 7:02 PM (Flight 3912). It was a direct flight to Washington-Dulles International Airport (IAD), which was suppose to hand a little after 9 PM. I got off the rental car, made it through security, and sat down at the gate at around 5:40 PM. At around 6:00 PM, the gate agent got on the PA and informed us that the plane had not yet left IAD due to a &quot;maintenance issue&quot; and that we probably wouldn&apos;t be leaving any time before 7:45 PM. She said that she could help people rebook their trips if this was going to cause them to miss their connections and would try to get hotel rooms for people who would opt to wait for the flight at 6 AM out of Burlington for IAD the next day. However, as she pointed out, there were no hotel rooms available in Burlington, due to a couple of college class reunions and a car show going on (we learned later that what this really meant was that the one hotel that took United vouchers was full and United won&apos;t pay for any other hotel -- or at least that was the message). After a hand-full of people made their way to the gate to get re-booked, the gate attendant came back on the PA at around 6:30 PM to announce that the plane had taken off from IAD and would land in Burlington around 8:00 PM. It would take about 20 minutes to turn the plane around, which would mean we would get into IAD at around 10:00 PM (not bad, since this is only an hour later than originally scheduled, if you overlook the whole &quot;maintenance&quot; issue with the plane that delayed it in the first place). Again, the gate attendant asked if anyone needed to re-book and spent roughly the next hour helping customers (we found out later that she worked for Delta, but had to cover the United gate).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Take It For a Test Drive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: left; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
	&lt;tbody&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					&lt;a style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; href=&quot;/blog/img/airplane7.jpg&quot;&gt;
						&lt;img width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;181&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/blog/img/airplane7.jpg&quot;&gt;
					&lt;/a&gt;
				&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;The funny thing about all of this is that the 2 gate attendants&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;and the 4 TSA workers couldn&apos;t go home until we took off,&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;so they were definitely motivated to get us out of there.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 8:00 PM, the plane from IAD landed and the passengers deplaned. There were about 30 of us left still waiting to get on the flight back to IAD. Just as all of the passengers got off the plane, one of the workers from the tarmac came in and took the PA microphone. He announced that there was another &quot;maintenance&quot; problem with the plane and it would take two hours to test. He would get back to us at that time with an update. In retrospect, this was the point where I should have just gone down stairs, rented a car, and drove the 10 hours from Burlington to my house outside of IAD. Needless to say, this news was met with a lot of complaints and comments. Again, a group of people tried to get re-booked and called around to find their own hotels. Luckily for me, Burlington International Airport has free WiFi, so I kicked back, plugged my laptop in and connected to my SlingBox (just to give you a sense of how long the delay was, I was able to watch two episodes of Family Guy and the first National Treasures movie in that time). Also during this time, one of the TSA workers &quot;hit the wrong button&quot; during a test that sounded an alarm that ordered &quot;all TSA personel to secure all exits&quot; to the terminal &quot;immediately&quot; (they quickly told us that this was an accident. At around 10:00 PM the same ground crew member came in to announce that the &quot;tests went well&quot; and they just needed to take the plane &quot;out for a test drive&quot;. Let me stop here and highlight how ridiculous this was. I have never heard of this before. They literally taxied the plane out on to the runway (with no passengers), started the engines up full speed and proceeded to drive around the runway &quot;testing&quot; the aircraft. This went on for about an hour. During this time, I believe that one of the gate attendants ran home to get her dog (or at least take care of her dog), while the other covered for her. At around 11 PM, the plane made its way back to the gate, but ran into another road block. While they were out joyriding in the plane, another plane had landed and pulled up to our gate to deplane. Our plane had to wait on the tarmac for this to unfold. So, at about 11:20, our plane pulled back up to the gate. The ground crew member came back inside an announced that the test drive was a success. They simply had to run on more final test and fill out some paperwork. He would get back to us in 35 minutes. This, obviously, was met with sarcastic comments and groans from the 20 or so of us left in the terminal. At about midnight, we finally lined up to get on the plane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Point of No Return&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;&quot;&gt;

				&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Our first attempt at landing  kind of went like this...&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
				&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					&lt;br&gt;
				&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve never seen a plane board that quickly. There was a good chuckle from the crowd when the gate attendant announced that &quot;premium&quot; customers were welcome to board first. We got on the plane and settled in about 5 or 10 minutes. I got a look at the pilots, who were both no older than 25 years old each (this will be important later). We pushed back from the terminal, taxied out to the runway and then nothing. We sat. And sat. And sat. After about 30 minutes, the pilot came on the intercom and told us that because it was so late, the air traffic control tower had shut down for the evening. He told us that normally this isn&apos;t a problem, as our plane got transferred to regional air traffic control. However, because the regional air traffic control was now in charge, we had to wait for all inbound planes to land first before being cleared for take off (this is obviously because they are not local to the air field and therefore can&apos;t see what is going on). So we waited. And waited. At a little after 1 AM, we finally took off. It had been delayed by over 5 hours, but we were finally going to get home, even if it was at 3 AM. The flight went smoothly (there were a few turbulence) and at around a little after 3 AM, the pilot notified us that we were starting our decent into the Washington metro area. There were low clouds over the area (we were flying above them) at a couple hundred feet. However, it was not fog: you could see through the clouds in spots and see the lights on the ground. I didn&apos;t think anything of it and assumed that we would be on the ground in minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Trust Your Instincts, Luke&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
	&lt;tbody&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					&lt;a style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; href=&quot;/blog/img/dontgo.png&quot;&gt;
						&lt;img width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;179&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/blog/img/dontgo.png&quot;&gt;
					&lt;/a&gt;
				&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Do you have anything to declare?  Yeah, don&apos;t fly United.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plane began its descent. The landing gear came down. We started getting closer to the ground. We started to go through the low lying clouds. Just as I thought that we were going to touch down, the engines went into full throttle, the plane pitched steeply up into the air and banked to the left, back towards Washington, D.C. and the DelMarVa peninsula. After a few minutes, the captain came on and stated that they could not see the runway at the required height, so they aborted the landing. They were going to try landing at a different runway (because that runway would magically have no clouds over it). A few minutes later we made attempt number two, with the same result. As we began circling, the pilot came on to say that he was in a conversation with air traffic control at IAD and regional air traffic control to see what the next step would be. I have no doubt that more experienced pilots would have landed that plane. About ten minutes later, the pilot came back on the intercom to say that we could not land at IAD would be diverted to Allentown, PA. He assured us that United would put us in hotels and help us arrange travel to IAD or some other destination. About 25 minutes later, we landed at the airport in Allentown, PA and again sat on another runway. The pilot told us that they were having trouble finding people at the airport to help us get to the gate. He also told us that &quot;things were changing over the last 30 minutes&quot; and that now the gate agent was trying to arrange &quot;transportation&quot; to IAD for us. We got off the plane and made our way inside to the gate area. After standing around for about 5 minutes, one of the ground crew members from outside came in and got on the microphone. He told us that he had arranged for buses to show up &quot;in 5 or 10 minutes&quot; to take us to IAD, if we were interested. The other option was to stay at the airport. This caught a bunch of people off guard and started asking about a hotel. He said that United would not pay for a hotel, because we were diverted &quot;due to weather&quot;. My jaw dropped, as did most of the people standing around the podium. We were diverted &quot;due to weather&quot; because United sent a faulty plane from IAD to Burlington (I wonder how mad the people on that flight would be if they knew the plane they had just gotten off of had 3 hours of maintenance work done on it after they landed). The reason we hit weather was obviously because of United and the issues to the plane. This was a clever trick on their part to get out of having to help their customers. It seems to me, it would have made much more sense to pay $80-90 a person to put the few who wanted to stay in Allentown up for the night and gain a ton of good will. Instead, they pissed off 20+ customers, who will now tell people about this hellish trip and why you shouldn&apos;t fly on United. I couldn&apos;t listen to this nonsense so I headed down stairs to baggage claim where the bus would supposedly meet us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Get On the Bus!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
	&lt;tbody&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					&lt;a style=&quot;clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; href=&quot;/blog/img/partybus.jpg&quot;&gt;
						&lt;img width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/blog/img/partybus.jpg&quot;&gt;
					&lt;/a&gt;
				&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Am I in Allentown or Las Vegas?&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so we waited. Again. We landed in Allentown at around 3:30 AM. The buses that were suppose to show up in 5-10 minutes finally showed up around 4 AM. I walked out of the baggage claim to find two booze cruise/party buses waiting to take us to IAD (complete with functioning interior LED disco lights and the &quot;Vomit/Destruction will cause you to forfeit your $500 deposit&quot; sign). You couldn&apos;t even sleep on this bus, because the seats are on the side, like in the picture to the left. So, in a darkened party bus, we pulled out of the airport in Allentown, PA for the three hour drive through Harrisburg, Gettysburg, Frederick, and finally Leesburg. In the middle of the trip at 5:43 AM, United called my house and sent me this e-mail:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;a style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; href=&quot;/blog/img/united.png&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;img width=&quot;303&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/blog/img/united.png&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I wish I was funny enough to make up that plot twist. Somehow the flight that didn&apos;t get cancelled when it should have been cancelled, got cancelled after I got off it in Allentown, PA. To add insult to injury, United apparently never updated their web site to say that the flight had been diverted, so people were waiting at IAD wondering what happened. I&apos;m sure this was classic CYA by United to make sure that they didn&apos;t have to pay anything out to those who stayed in Burlington, VT, as they are not liable if it is cancelled due to weather. So, at 8 AM, we finally pulled into IAD on our party buses. A little over 13 hours from when I was suppose to leave Burlington, I made it home. There was no snow. There was no rain. There was no hurricane or tornado or typhoon. Or earthquake. There was only United Airlines and its terrible customer service. Not a bad way to spend a Friday night, eh?&lt;/p&gt;
