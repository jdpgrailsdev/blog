In an attempt to get myself to start blogging more regularly, I have decided to re-do my blog (which has largely been dormant).  A few days ago,
I read an interesting blog post by http://melix.github.io/blog//2014/02/hosting-jbake-github.html[CÃ©dric Champeau, window="_blank"] about using {jbake} to generate
blog posts from {markdown}, {asciidoc} or HTML and publish them to {github}.  The blog post is pretty straight forward and with some minor tweaks
I was able to give my blog a makeover.  Additionally, its much easier now to author and publish posts.  Over the next few weeks, I am going to continue
to make tweaks to give the blog my own style.
