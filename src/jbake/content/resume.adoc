== Headline

Software developer who is not afraid to tackle any challenge. My current focus is on building and supporting robust, scalable web-based applications that run on the JVM, evangelism of technology
and mentoring.  I am always open to expanding my knowledge of new technologies, techniques and tricks.  I believe in  writing unit tests, running performance tests and finding  creative ways to
make sure that the http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KME46w6jU74["flowers are still standing", window="_blank"] when performing architecture refactors. I enjoy contributing to open source projects and collaborating
with others.
