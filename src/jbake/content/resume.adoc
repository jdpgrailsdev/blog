== Headline

Software developer who is not afraid to tackle any challenge. My current focus +
is on building and supporting robust, scalable stream processing applications that +
run on the JVM, evangelism of technology and mentoring.  I am always open to expanding +
my knowledge of new technologies, techniques and tricks.  I believe in  writing unit +
tests, running performance tests and finding creative ways to make sure that that +
reliability is front of mind when performing architecture refactors. I enjoy +
contributing to open source projects and collaborating with others.
