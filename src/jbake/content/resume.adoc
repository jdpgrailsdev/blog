== Headline

Software developer who is not afraid to tackle any challenge. My current focus is on
building and supporting robust, scalable distributed applications that run on the JVM,
evangelism of technology and mentoring. I am always open to expanding my knowledge of new
technologies, techniques and tricks. I believe in writing unit tests, running performance
tests and finding creative ways to make sure that reliability is front of mind when performing
architecture refactors. I enjoy contributing to open source projects and collaborating with others.
